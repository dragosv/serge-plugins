These plugins are supplementing the built-in Serge translation software plugin, [Pootle (Open Source)](https://pootle.translatehouse.org/).

## Installation

If you want to install and use the plugins then just install it via cpanm. 

```
cpanm install Serge::Sync::Plugin::TranslationService::plugin

```

## Development setup

If you want to develop a feature, or contribute code in some way, you need a development setup. This is done by cloning
the repo into a local directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/dragosv/serge-plugins.git
cd serge-plugins
```

With carton you can install all the dependencies needed in a local environment, so you can play around with dependencies without
affecting the system libraries. The cpanfile is used to track the dependencies needed.

```
cpanm install Carton
carton install
```

## Organization

lib/Serge/Sync/Plugin/TranslationService: Contains translation services plugins.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are versioned in a cpanfile. If you have carton, just execute 'carton install' in the sdk directory, and all dependencies
will be pulled in automatically into a local library path. After that use 'carton exec ...' to execute your scripts.

If you add a dependency, just add it to the cpanfile file. There are three sections:

 - the general section is for dependencies that are needed only in runtime
 - the test section is for dependencies needed to run the test suite
 - the develop section is for dependencies needed for developers

carton install installs all dependencies in all sections (after all, we're in developer mode here) 

## Packaging

Packaging is managed with Dist::Zilla.
